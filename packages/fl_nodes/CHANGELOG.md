Special thanks to [Blokyk](https://github.com/Blokyk) for many of these improvements! ðŸ™Œ

## 0.4.0

- **Localization Support**:

  - Built-in system makes it easy to localize node-based UIs.
  - Integrates seamlessly with Flutterâ€™s `l10n` but also supports custom locale management.
  - Ships with translations for common languages via a delegate (extensible by developers).
  - Node labels can now directly adapt to the build context for simpler localization.

- **State Management Overhaul**:

  - Completely redesigned state system for smoother interactions and peak performance across devices.

## 0.4.0+1 (Hotfix)

- **Fix Layout Errors**: Fixed text layout errors from nodes beyond viewport when swithcing locale.
  ([#90](https://github.com/WilliamKarolDiCioccio/fl_nodes/pull/90))

Perfect â€” hereâ€™s a continuation of your changelog, following your established tone and formatting style:

---

## 0.5.0

- **Automatic Actions**
  Introduced a new system for automatic project operations:

  - _Auto-run_: graphs can now execute automatically when inputs change.
  - _Auto-save_: projects are saved periodically or after important edits.
  - _Auto-refresh_: rebuilds cached node data when environmental factors change.

- **Improved Controller Architecture**
  The controller now relies on a dedicated **project data model**, laying the foundation for:

  - future **save file versioning**,
  - **advanced project management** (multiple projects, snapshots, history, etc.).

- **Bug Fixes**

  - Fixed layout and text rendering inconsistencies on Web after opening modals or changing locales.
    ([#101](https://github.com/WilliamKarolDiCioccio/fl_nodes/pull/101))
  - Fixed missing text rendering in non-Latin locales (CJK, Korean, etc.).
    ([#90](https://github.com/WilliamKarolDiCioccio/fl_nodes/pull/90))

- **Internal Improvements**

  - Refactored caching logic in custom render objects to ensure consistency across platforms.
  - Improved layout synchronization and stability during portal (overlay) transitions.

## 0.5.0+1

- **Fixed auto-save**: Fixed project helper not checking auto-save flag but therefore ignoring configuration.
