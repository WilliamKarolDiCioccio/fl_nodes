## 🏗️ Framework Architecture

The FlNodes Framework is organized as a monorepo with specialized packages:

### 📦 Core Packages

- [**`fl_nodes_core`**](https://github.com/WilliamKarolDiCioccio/fl_nodes/tree/main/packages/fl_nodes_core) – The engine that powers the FlNodes Framework.

- [**`fl_nodes`**](https://github.com/WilliamKarolDiCioccio/fl_nodes/tree/main/packages/fl_nodes) – A proxy export package that maintains backward compatibility with earlier versions of the FlNodes framework.

### 🔌 Coming Soon

- **`fl_nodes_visual_scripting`**
- **`fl_nodes_mind_maps`**
- **`fl_nodes_flow_graphs`**

## 📚 **Getting Started**

For a fast and easy setup, check out our [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/WilliamKarolDiCioccio/fl_nodes/wiki/Quickstart). It covers the basics to get you up and running with **FlNodes** in no time!

If you're migrating from an earlier version, the `fl_nodes` package maintains backward compatibility while providing access to the new modular architecture.

---

## 📦 **Installation**

Choose the package that fits your needs:

```yaml
dependencies:
  # For most users - high-level API with full features
  fl_nodes: ^latest_version

  # For advanced users needing low-level control
  fl_nodes_core: ^latest_version
```

Regardless of the package you choose you must add the following asset:

```yaml
flutter:
  shaders:
    - packages/fl_nodes_core/shaders/grid.frag
```

Then, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```
