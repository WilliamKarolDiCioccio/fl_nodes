## 🚀 **A Fully Customizable Node-Based Editor for Flutter**

**FlNodes** is a lightweight, scalable, and highly customizable Flutter package for building interactive, node-based user interfaces.

### 💡 Use Cases

Whether you're building tools for developers, designers, or end-users, **FlNodes** provides the building blocks for:

- 🎮 **Visual Scripting Editors** – Game logic, automation flows, or state machines.

- 🛠 **Workflow & Process Designers** – Business rules, decision trees, and automation paths.

- 🎨 **Shader & Material Graphs** – Build custom shaders visually.

- 📊 **Dataflow Tools** – ETL pipelines, AI workflows, and processing graphs.

- 🤖 **ML Architecture Visualizers** – Visualize and configure neural networks.

- 🔊 **Modular Audio Systems** – Synthesizers, effect chains, or sequencing tools.

- 🧠 **Graph-Based UIs** – Mind maps, dependency trees, and hierarchical structures.

---

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ **Customizable UI** – Fully override widgets, ports, fields, and layout logic.

- 💾 **Pluggable Storage** – Save/load via JSON with full control over serialization.

- ⚡ **Optimized Performance** – Hardware-accelerated, efficient hit testing and rebuild minimization.

- 🔗 **Flexible Graph System** – Directional edges, nested data, typed ports, and more.

- 📏 **Scalable Architecture** – Suitable for both lightweight diagrams and complex editors.

- 🎨 **Lightweight & Elegant** – Minimal dependencies, beautiful out of the box, and easy to style.

---

## 🛠 Roadmap

We're iterating fast, thanks to community adoption, forks, and feedback. Here's what’s next:

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Community Feedback

- Addressing common issues raised in GitHub discussions and forks.

- Fixes for node field state persistence and ID mismatches.

- Improvements to hit testing and z-ordering in dense graphs.

### ⚙️ Performance Enhancements

- **Surgical Rebuilds** – Rebuild only the nodes affected by data or structural changes.

- **Static Branch Precomputation** – Improve runtime by detecting and collapsing static branches in execution graphs.

### 📚 Documentation Improvements

- Expanded API docs and usage examples.

- Guides for building non-scripting tools like mind maps, audio tools, or ML visualizers.

### 🎛 General-Purpose Flexibility

- 🤖 **Node Configuration State Machine** – Dynamically add or remove ports and fields on nodes at runtime, allowing node structure to adapt automatically based on current links and input data.

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Node Grouping** – Enable users to select multiple nodes and group them together for easier organization, movement, and management within complex graphs.

- ♻️ **Reusable Graph Macros** – Allow users to define, save, and reuse templates or functions made up of multiple nodes, streamlining the creation of common patterns and workflows.

- 🎩 **Enhanced Editor Mode** – Introduce advanced, opt-in editing tools and keyboard shortcuts to improve productivity and provide a more powerful graph editing experience.
